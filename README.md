This is the script accompanying the tutorial here: https://will-stanton.com/2015/03/08/machine-learning-with-r-an-irresponsibly-fast-tutorial/

I only tidied up the code somewhat to make it more usable for novice R users.

It implements a Random Forest model on the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle to predict which passengers survived or died. It demonstrates how to implement this simple machine learning model and 

To use:
1. Ensure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) AND [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed.
2. Download this repository to your computer (Git savvy folks can fork and clone the repo instead if they wish).
3. Open titanic-random-forest.Rproj in R Studio, this will automatically set the working directory to wherever the .Rproj file ([more info on using R Project files](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)) is located on your hard drive.
4. Open the r script titanic.R in R Studio.
5. From here, you should be able to simply run the R script from start to finish without any errors. However, I highly recommend following along with the tutorial linked above and running the code line-by-line while trying to understand what each line does.
